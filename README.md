- .&Code is an desktop adaptive online compiler which can come handy to developers for some quick operation or tests as well as it can be quite helpful during any interview.
- It uses Monaco editor to power it up as an editor to give the best experience to the programmer while writing codes and it uses Judge0 api service to provide the compilation power to support more than 40 programming languages.


## Operate in local system
  - This react app is created using CRA(Create-React-App).
  - To operate this code in local system, clone this repository to your system and install all dependencies.
  - You can use the command 'npm install' to install all dependencies at once.
  - More over you need to create a profile for the Judge0 API to get the Host and Key for authentication.
  - Create an .env file and define your Host, API key and the Api URL.
  - Your .env file should look like this :-
 
    REACT_APP_RAPID_API_HOST = your host
    REACT_APP_RAPID_API_KEY = your api key
    REACT_APP_RAPID_API_URL = your api url
